<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spicy coconut curry ramen with crispy shiitakes. Imagine an ultra creamy, slightly spicy broth simmered with quick-cooking ramen noodles plus all the ingredients you love in Thai food for a huge flavor punch. Ready in 20 minutes, super hearty, made in one pot and pretty versatile too. Out of chives? Use scallions or cilantro! Not a fan of shiitakes? Swap for sautéed eggplant. Want a fully loaded ramen? Broccoli or rotisserie chicken are happy to help.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 tbsp toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
  <li>100 g/3.5 oz shiitakes, torn</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, grated</li>
  <li>1 tbsp freshly grated ginger</li>
  <li>4 cups chicken broth, or vegetable</li>
  <li>½ tsp each: ground turmeric, brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp sambal, or other chili paste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp mild red curry paste</li>
  <li>1 can (400 g/15 oz) unsweetened coconut milk</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
  <li>250 g/9 oz instant ramen noodles</li>
  <li>for serving: chili oil, sesame seeds, chives</li>
  <li>4 boiled eggs, cooked for 7 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get the prep done before you start cooking: grate the garlic and ginger. Tear the shiitakes into small pieces.</li>
  <li>Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in a large pot over medium. Add shiitakes, and cook until they start to brown. Sprinkle with 1 tbsp sesame oil, season with salt and pepper, cook until crispy. Remove from pot.</li>
  <li>Reduce the heat to low. Again, add 1 tbsp sesame oil, garlic and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pot with chicken broth, stir with a wooden spoon while scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of your pot. Bring to a boil.</li>
  <li>Add turmeric, brown sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce. Stir in red curry paste and sambal. Add coconut milk and squeeze in lime juice. When the broth starts to boil, add ramen noodles and cook for 2 minutes ( If not serving right away, cook the ramen noodles separately otherwise they'll soak up the broth).</li>
  <li>Serve immediately finished off with shiitakes, sesame seeds, chives and chili oil. Top with eggs, enjoy!</li>
